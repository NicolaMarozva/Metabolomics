# DCHS Metabolomics dataset 			 				 

## Nightingale Results (10 June 2024) 
N ~ 2107  Metabolomics biomarkers from  blood samples at 1, 2, 5, 6, and 10 years)
Metabolomics results available on G-drive - link in https://netstorage.uct.ac.za/oneNet/NetStorage/DriveG@DATSHR202/Drakenstein%20Child%20Lung%20Health%20Study


Data includes a **broad range of metabolites**, including:
- Lipids & lipoprotein subclasses (HDL, LDL, VLDL particle counts and lipid content)
- Fatty acids (saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, omega-3, omega-6 ratios)
- Amino acids (e.g., branched-chain amino acids)
- Glycolysis-related metabolites (glucose, lactate, pyruvate)
- Ketone bodies (acetoacetate, 3-hydroxybutyrate)
- Inflammatory markers (e.g., glycoprotein acetyls)
